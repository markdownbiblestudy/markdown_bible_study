# WELCOME TO MY BIBLE STUDY

Welcome to Parker's Bible Study: the best series of markdown files you will **EVER** read!!

I have sorted my notes into 2 main sections:
* The Old Testament
* The New Testament

And both of these sections have further sections in them with all of the books of the bible ~~at least that's the plan~~.

The title will show which chapters I cover and you'll see my thoughts for that section of the bible. It should be very easy to navigate.

A little bit of information about this series:
* At the time of me starting this I am an atheist
* I am reading this with an open mind and could possibly be converted ~~though I doubt that'll happen~~.
* These will be updated regularly on my github.
* I will be sure to put down as much as I can and give you guys some contex into my thoughts. If I have to, I'll even include some verses.

Oh here's one thing to note: I am reading an LDS Bible. **NOT THE BOOK OF MORMON**
I've done research and nothing seems to suggest anything has been altered in the LDS Bible, other than the removal of the Apocypha.
This thing also has headers that give a cliffnotes version of the chapter. If you ask me this is for Mormons ~~like myself at one point~~ who were too lazy to read the book and wanted to act like they knew something. :^)

So that's it! I'm gonna provide some comedic feedback on the Bible and probably offend some Christians out there!!

# HAVE FUN!!!!!!
