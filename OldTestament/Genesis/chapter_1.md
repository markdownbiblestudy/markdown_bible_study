# GENESIS CHAPTER 1
## Written on 09/04/16

So I'm pretty sure anyone who's lived on the planet knows somewhat about the story about God creating the universe. Anyone who falls into an Abrahamic religion knows this story by heart. So reading this honestly feels like watching that movie that you've seen a lot. Except it's not a good movie. :-/

# So anyways let's get on to the notes:
------------------

Okay so the first day goes by and God makes light and darkness. **But**, I do notice that he didn't make the water. It was just there.

### Chapter 1 Verse 1&2:
> In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.
>
> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness *was* upon the fave of the deep, And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

So.... where the fuck did the water come from?? I would say that it was made when the earth was made in the first verse, but verse 2 clearly says that the earth _was void_. If we take the Bible literally, then there was nothing on the earth! BUT THEN THERE'S FUCKING WATER THERE HOW THE HELL IS THAT POSSIBLE??? 

-------------------

OK WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!?!

### Chapter 1 Verse 6-8:
> And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
>
> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which *were* under the firmament from the waters which _were_ above the firmament: and it was so. 
>
> And God called teh firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.


King James, God, whoever wrote this: WHAT'S A FIRMAMENT? See, I thought it was land at first, but then I guess God decides to go one fuckin level above the and make it heaven. BUT WHY USE FIRMAMENT???? I guess this was written back in King James' time so maybe it was a common word I dunno.

I don't remember the story entirely so I have a feeling that this is the moon????

Also something to note: God made "the heaven" in verse 1, but then he made "Heaven" from the firmament in verse 8. So now we clearly see that God has established the proper nouns from the regular nouns.

-------------------

Okay so we're in the third day now; God has just made land and oceans, and now he's making plants. 

Wait is God actually making plants?

He's basically just saying shit and it appears. Is the universe just taking orders from him? According to the Bible, God doesn't go around telling each species of fruit to form. If he did, he'd be there for years probably.

-------------------

OH BOY WHAT'S GOD GONNA MAKE ON THE FOURTH DAY?!?!

Shit he's doing stuff with the firmament.

Oh he's making stars. And he's already giving the stars a purpose with signs and seasons and years. 

### Chapter 1 Verse 16:
> And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: *he made* the stars also.

OH BOY GUYS THE MOON MAKES LIGHT!!!

I remember Bill Nye on Bill Maher's show talking about this. He was saying that he pointed out that the moon reflects and a mother removed herself and her children from the audience. I don't wanna comment on religious people in general, but her kind are really fun to poke fun at.

Okay I think I get what the firmament is now. I think it's the sky.

So the sky is make of the same stuff the the earth is.

------------------

So the fifth day comes around and God makes all the animals in the earth. 

And if I'm reading this correctly, according to verse 20, God made animals come from the water. Like.... all of them.
I guess creatures are around 2/3rds water so that kinda does make sense. :^)

### Chapter 1 Verse 22 as told by Parker:
> And God told the animals, HEY Y'ALL SHOULD EAT SOME SHIT AND HAVE SEX

------------------

I'm gonna be completly honest it's 12:30AM my time and I'm really tired so if some of my jokes don't make sense then I'M SORRY.

God is aparantly not done making animals yet. Now he's making beasts I guess. 

Okay I'm not gonna type this all down because I'm fucking lazy but if you look at verses 24 and 25, you'll see that 95% of both verses are copied. So whoever King James got to write this verse is a fucking non-creative dumbass. Good fucking job.

**NOW WE'RE FINALLY MAKING MAN WOOOOOOOOOOO**

Now God's giving mankind ultimate domain over the land and putting us at the top of the food chain because we kinda look like him. AND THEN HE'S TELLING THEM TO GO HAVE SEX AGAIN WEEEWWW. 

God just declared that all the animals are herbivores and so are humans.

I just looked into the next chapter a litle and that's the chapter where he makes Adam and ~~St~~Eve. So God basically just wrote the code for humans but he hasn't launched it yet. 

Okay, I'm fucking tired and I wanna sleep so I guess that's it for this chapter.

fuck i've got so many chapters to do this is gonna take a while
